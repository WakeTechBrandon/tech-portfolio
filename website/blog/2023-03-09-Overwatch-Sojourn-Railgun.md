# Overwatch 2

The introduction of a railgun type weapon into Overwatch's cast of hero abilities came with it's own set of difficulties and new problems.    
High level players were forced into using this character for the purpose of abusing the One-Shot mechanic that was easy to obtain, hit, and a hero kit built around the ability.    
At 1 charge, the hitbox was akin to pixel perfect (Widowmaker for instance) and as charge built up to 100 the hitbox grew to the same size as Hanzo's projectile arrows.    
Having a hitscan (instant travel time and unaffected by gravity) weapon that also had a hitbox size of a projectile that One-Shot heros while also having a difficult character hitbox, high mobility, and a utility ability to flush players out from corners was insanely broken.    
How should it function instead?
