# Overwatch 2

<!--truncate-->

Overwatch 2 is not cunsumer-friendly

Lean harder into the Battle-Pass model

Removing the career progression level was bad.

Legeacy content is not the same value as Overwatch 2 content.

$60 got you everything in Overwatch 1.

Legacy content should not be included in the store at all. I have two different ways to implement legacy content:

- Overwatch 1 content is contained inside of a predetermind career legacy pass. Every career level up grants the next tier which can be viewed at any time.
  - You cannot buy tiers.
  - All content is available for free for Legacy players, and $60 to activate for new players
  - It is essentially the same system as lootboxes, but you can see what you obtain at future tiers (Lootbox content was determined when obtained not opened)
- Overwatch 1 content is split into 6 legacy battle passes.
  - Functions the same and runs parallel to the seasonal pass.
  - Can only have 1 legacy pass active at a time.
  - All Overwatch 1 content is spread across the 6 passes and total $60.
  - When a season ends, the Seasonal pass is added to the legacy passes for future purchases.
- All Overwatch 1 content is removed from the shop. Completely, and entirely.
- All Overwatch 2 skin prices are reverted to Overwatch 1 style:
  - 3000 New Legendary
  - 1000 Old Legendary
  - 1000 New Epic
  - 250 Old Epic
- The Battle-Pass costs 3000 coins, or $10 for two weeks after the season starts.
  - Battle-Pass has 20 more tiers. increased from 80 to 100.
    - Free-Pass offers 3000 coins spread across 10 new tiers. 300 per tier
    - Premium-Pass offers 3000 coins spread across 10 new tiers. 300 per tier
  - The purpose of adding currency to the battlepass is to create an in-game economy in which players decide if they want a legendary skin, the next battlepass, or the current battlepass.
- Facillitate grinding, but catch new players up quickly.
  - When a player does not login during a day, they build up a battlepass experience multiplyer that caps out after 1 week. 
  - Winning a game will flush out the counter and apply the reward.
  - Maybe they can implement a similar version for win/losses to decrease loss aversion
    - This idea comes from WoW (Surprise, Blizzard doesn't maintain good ideas between games)
- Add more varients of Gold guns. 
  - Maybe one for each rank, and they cost significantly more:
    - 1000 Bronze, 2000 Silver, *3000 Gold*, 4000 Platinum, 5000 Diamond
  - Maybe Masters and Grandmasters varients look the best and are huge CP economy sinks.
  - Maybe you can only obtain them if your career high is that rank or higher.
- Add better challenges.
  - The current lifetime and seasonal challenges are not difficult enough to facillitate gameplay progress.
    - (I comeback stronger)           Lose the first round, but win the match 10000 times.
    - (I am the best version of me)   Get the final blow on an enemy playing the same hero as you 10000 times.
    - (Master Defender)               Prevent the capture of the first point on 10000 maps
  - The hero challenges are not varried and difficult enough to facillitate gameplay progress.
    - Roadhog: (Hook, Line, Sinker)   Recieve an environmental kill on an enemy who is currently under the effect of an ultimate ability.
    - Soldier: (Lock the legs)        Run a total of 1000 miles across all gamemodes.
    - Junkrat: (Aireal Bomber)        Eliminate 1000 airborne enemies.
  - The current formatting of the seasonal challenges leads to an exaggeration of the player confusion caused by the combination of the competitive ranking system and private career profiles.
